        Harry Potter is a film series based on the eponymous novels by J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists
        of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the
        Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011). A spin-off prequel series that is planned to consist of five films started with Fantastic Beasts
        and Where to Find Them (2016), marking the beginning of the Wizarding World shared media franchise. The series was mainly produced
        by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron
        Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Mike Newell, and David Yates.
        Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), while the remaining films' screenplays
        were written by Steve Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry's quest to overcome his
        arch-enemy Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two
        feature-length parts. Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.
