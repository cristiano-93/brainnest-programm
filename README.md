## Week1
This exercise goal was to create a website with a few pages with lists and links to some of my interests and hobbies.
No CSS was allowed for this project which is why it looks like an ancient website with no styling.

## Week2
This exercise goal was to use HTML and CSS to replicate the design provided by the mentor.

## Week 3
This exercise goal was to create a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript to handle the logic and to display the game on the browser console.

## Week 4
This exercise goal was to create a UI interface for the previous week's exercise and to create a calculator using JavaScript.
